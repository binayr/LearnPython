This machine has it's own attribute like dimention, power input, etc. They have smaller devices within the big machine, one molds the body of the phone, one manufactures the PCB, one manufacture the lcd, finally one device assembles all the parts with the battery and passes on to the next device that loads the OS into the cellphone. \n",

That is a little bit different. which makes it a class. while we discuss more features of the class we will come accross many other concepts and compare that with the cellphone building machine. \n",
