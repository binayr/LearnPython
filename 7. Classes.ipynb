    "------------------------------\n",
    "Let imagine we have a machine that manufactures cellphones. This machine takes metal, plastic, batteries and some othe equipments at one end and produce saveral equally capable and working and cellphones at the other end. This machine has it's own attribute like dimention, power input, etc. They have smaller devices within the big machine, one molds the body of the phone, one manufactures the PCB, one manufacture the lcd, finally one device assembles all the parts with the battery and passes on to the next device that loads the OS into the cellphone. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the cellphone is ready it has it's own dimentions, battery life, resolution, os version etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This big machine is like the class, machines dimentions and all are it's attributes. The smaller devices that does several tasks are like the class methods. When this methods work on the metal casing to give it the shape of mobile phone. this method is applying some action on the casing to change it into something else. but unlike the devices big machine is assembling the pieces and applying some methods and producing several products. That is a little bit different. which makes it a class. while we discuss more features of the class we will come accross many other concepts and compare that with the cellphone building machine. \n",

    "The other example we will discuss by the time we reach to the end of the tutorial."
